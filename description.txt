Antisocial allows all social accessory slots to be used as normal accessory slots. It's super cheaty, obviously.

A config allows for social armor to also be used, as well as limiting the number of affected social accessory slots.

Modded accessory slots are also affected, there is a config toggle for this behavior as well.

When using HERO's Mod, the "Modify Antisocial Config" can be used to limit who can change the config settings.
