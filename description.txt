Antisocial allows all social accessory slots to be used as normal accessory slots. It's super cheaty, obviously.

A config allows for social armor to also be used, as well as limiting the number of affected social accessory slots.

When using HerosMod, the "Modify Antisocial Config" can be used to limit who can change the config settings.
